I'm Madhavan BD

### About Me!

I am a Software Engineer at Saama Technologies, with a background in Computer Science from KG College of Arts and Science, Tamil Nadu. Over the past two years, I have gained valuable experience in the IT and services industry.

My current focus lies in exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), as I am deeply passionate about leveraging their capabilities. This passion has led me to develop a keen interest in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

My journey into ML and DL began with a fascination for artificial intelligence (AI). I quickly realized that Data Science effectively integrates both ML and DL, which motivated me to undertake a 6-month Data Science course. Throughout the course, I found the subject to be captivating and have since been committed to expanding my knowledge further.
